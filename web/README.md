# Jsx Mail Web

This is the web project where it contains all the jsx mail documentation, description of examples, and even articles made to facilitate the understanding of the use of the framework and to promote new changes and alterations.

## Requirements

- Node.js LTS
- PNPM 7.\*

## Running

First step to run the web project is to clone the jsx mail repository and install the project's dependencies, to do this run the commands below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Theryston/jsx-mail.git
cd jsx-mail
pnpm install
```

Right after doing this `pnpm` will start downloading the packages needed for the project. Just wait for this process to finish and after that enter the `web` folder and run the `dev` script with the following command:

```bash
cd web
pnpm dev
```

Congratulations! the jsx mail web application will be running on port 3000, so now just open your browser at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## What can I do here?

Recently working hard to write and improve the jsx mail documentation more and more, and all the documentation is here. on the `web` you can check what we have to do in the [documentation issues](https://github.com/Theryston/jsx-mail/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adocumentation)
