# Concept

The concept of an email template creation framework is very important to understand.

JSX Mail is a framework that allows you to create email templates using jsx syntax. This makes it easy to create and manage email templates, as well as to reuse components and code across different projects.

## Clean code

The code can be more clean and concise with Jsx Mail because you don't have to write HTML tags every time you want to create an element. With Jsx Mail, you can simply write the code like you would write HTML, and the framework will take care of the rest.

Another advantage of using Jsx Mail is that it makes it easy to reuse components across different templates. This means you don't have to write the same code over and over again for each template.

## JSX side and JS side

In Jsx Mail we have 2 sides. The first side is the JSX side, it should be a folder where inside it there is a file called `index.tsx` which is the [configuration file](/index-file). In this folder there is what we call the jsx side which is where all your email templates are, all your jsx code.

The js side is your application. It can be a rest api, a lambda, or anything. just install `jsx-mail` on it and you can run a function called `render` that will return an `HTML` that can be sent to your email

```jsx
// jsx-side
export function Welcome({ name }) {
  return <h1>{name} Welcome to jsx-mail</h1>;
}
```

```js
// js-side
import { render } from 'jsx-mail';
const template = await render('Welcome', { name: 'John' });

console.log(template); // <html>...<h1>John Welcome to jsx-mail</h1>...</html>
```

We go into more detail on how to do each of the things listed here in the [get started](/get-started)
