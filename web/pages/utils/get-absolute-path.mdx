# Get absolute path util

```js
import { getAbsolutePath } from 'jsx-mail';

const somePath = getAbsolutePath('/some/path');

console.log(somePath); // C:/projects/my-api/mail-app/some/path;
```

The `getAbsolutePath` util is a util that returns the absolute path of a file/folder that is at the root of your email application. Your email application is the folder where the `index.tsx` file exists, the same as the path in the `mailPath` parameter in your `jsx-mail.json` file
