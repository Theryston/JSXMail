# Image Component

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Image, Group } from '@jsx-mail/components';
import { getAbsolutePath } from 'jsx-mail';

const component = ({ name }) => {
  return (
    <Group>
      <h1>{name}, see this:</h1>
      <Image
        alt="Image from url"
        height="128"
        width="128"
        src="https://i.ibb.co/GdDPZRf/Ellipse-6.png"
      />
      <Image
        alt="Image from path"
        path={getAbsolutePath('assets/screenshot.png')}
      />
    </Group>
  );
};
```

The image component is a component made to save lives by having to send an image in an email template. Basically it will display an image on the screen as the HTML `img` tag. But with some features such as automatic image hosting among others...

## Props

The `Image` component has two main props. One is `src` and one is `path`

If your image is on a host and you have its url, you must pass the image url to the `src` prop, as in the example below:

```tsx
<Image alt="Image from url" src="https://i.ibb.co/GdDPZRf/Ellipse-6.png" />
```

But if you don't have the url of the image and it is in your project you can pass the absolute path of the image in the `path` prop that the Image component will automatically host it on the site [https://imgbb.com](https://imgbb.com/)

To get the absolute path of your image use the util called `getAbsolutePath` from inside the `jsx-mail` package [See more about this util here](/utils/get-absolute-path)

```tsx
<Image alt="Image from path" path={getAbsolutePath('assets/screenshot.png')} />
```
