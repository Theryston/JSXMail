# Sending Emails

JSX Mail has the JSX Mail Cloud very well integrated, which allows you to send millions of emails simply and without worrying about infrastructure or other things.

## Senders

Senders are email addresses that can be used to send your emails, senders are generally `your_username@your-domain.com`, to send emails with JSX Mail Cloud you need to have at least 1 sender created.

### Domains

To create a sender you can use the default JSX Mail domain (jsxmail.org) or configure a custom domain, to configure a custom domain [login](/cloud/sign-in) then click on the profile photo and then click in the "Resources" section just create your domain and verify it.

To check you need to click on "verify" and then enter the DNS records for your domain, after entering wait a few minutes and refresh the page.

### Creating Senders

Once you have your domains configured, on the [same page](/cloud/app/resources) in the "Senders" section you can create a sender with your domain, username and sender name


## Sending Emails

Before sending an email, it is good to keep in mind that you must first follow the [JSX Mail Cloud login](/docs/cloud#local-login) process.

Now you can send an email using JSX Mail Cloud. Here below is an example of how to do this:

```javascript
const jsxMail = require('jsx-mail');

await jsxMail.send('your:template:name', { 
  subject: 'Your Email Subject',
  to: ['example@example.com'],
  sender: 'example@your-domain.com',
  props: { key: 'value' },
});
```
- The `sender` param is optional and can be used to specify the sender of the email. The senders is from your JSX Mail Cloud account and you can see all your senders on the section "Senders" from [your JSX Mail Cloud resources](/cloud/app/resources).
	- If you don't specify your sender, it will take the last created sender from your account.
	- You also can specify your sender from your JSX Mail configuration file, just by setting `defaultSender` on the configuration object. Just like:

  ```javascript filename="jsx-mail.config.js"
    /** @type {import('jsx-mail').JsxMailConfig} */
    module.exports = {
      dir: 'mail',
      defaultSender: 'example@jsxmail.org',
    };
  ```

- The `props` param is also optional and can be used to pass props to the template, just if the template requires props.
