# Preview Feature

The Preview feature in JSX Mail acts as an interactive simulator, enabling real-time visualization of your email templates. This tool is specifically engineered to streamline and enhance the template development process.

### How to Use Preview

To activate Preview, execute the `preview` (or its shorthand `pv`) command in the Command Line Interface (CLI). This initiates the Preview on your web browser, accessible via port `3256`.

To start the Preview, use either of the following commands:

```sh copy
yarn jsxm preview
```

Or:

```sh copy
yarn jsxm pv
```

After running the command, visit: [http://localhost:3256](http://localhost:3256)

### Cache
The Preview automatically [clears the cache](/docs/cache-clean).

### Update

Finally, the updated HTML of your open email template is sent via websocket.

This dynamic updating ensures that you always have a real-time view of how your email templates will appear, significantly improving your development workflow.
