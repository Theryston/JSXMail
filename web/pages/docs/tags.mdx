# Tags

As a JSX framework, JSX Mail offers some JSX tags that you can use. All tags were carefully created to ensure compatibility with your email template, so here you can see all the props that each tag accepts and what the result of compiling them is.

## `<a />`

The `<a />` tag is used to create links in your email. It accepts the following props:

| Prop | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `className` | `string` | Some class to the result HTML |
| `href` | `string` | The link URL |
| `id` | `string` | Some ID to the result HTML |
| `style` | `JSX.ElementStyle` | Some style to the result HTML |
