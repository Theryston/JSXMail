import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout';

# Get Started

This page is an overview of the Jsx Mail documentation and related resources. In it we will create your first mail app.

To get started just create a folder with the name you prefer (we will name it `jsx-hello` in this example) inside that folder you can start a project using your favorite node module package, in this case we will use pnpm. To do this just run:

```bash
mkdir jsx-hello
cd jsx-hello
pnpm init
code .
```

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  The `code .` command is just to open the project in [visual studio
  code](https://code.visualstudio.com), if you have another favorite code editor
  feel free to open it
</Callout>

Now let's install in this project the necessary dependencies to run jsx mail. The required development dependency is `@jsx-mail/cli` and the others are: `react`, `styled-components`, `jsx-mail` and `@jsx-mail/components`. To install them, run:

```bash
pnpm add -D @jsx-mail/cli
pnpm add @jsx-mail/components jsx-mail react styled-components
```

After installation we are ready to start the mail application with the jsx mail cli. To do this initialization is super simple, just run the following command:

```bash
pnpm jsxm init
```

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  In this case, `pnpm` before the `jsxm init` command is used to trigger the cli
  currently installed in the project. You can replace this with `yarn` if you
  are using it
</Callout>

After executing this command the cli will ask you some questions. In the first question you must inform the name of the folder where your email application will be (it must not be in a subfolder like `src/mail-app`, it must be a folder in the root like `mail-app`). And the second question is what language is your email template in, you should enter something like `en-US`.

## Overview by files

With `init` process successfully executed, new files and folders will be generated and your project's folder tree will look something like this:

```bash
â”‚   jsx-mail.json
â”‚   package.json
â”‚   pnpm-lock.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€â”€mail
â”‚   â”‚   index.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€templates
â”‚           Welcome.tsx
â””â”€â”€â”€node_modules
```

- `jsx-mail.json` - File contains jsx mail settings, you can see more about it [here](/docs/json-file)
- `node_modules` - Folder that contains the installed packages of node js, this folder does not matter now and I believe you already know about it
- `mail` - This is the folder named with the name of the first question asked by the jsx mail cli when you ran the `init` command inside that folder has all the `jsx` or `tsx` files, these will be the files compiled and processed by Jsx Mail
- `mail/index.tsx` - This is the file that exports all templates and their properties. you can learn more about him [here](/docs/index-file)
- `mail/templates` - This folder should contain all the email templates.
- `mail/templates/Welcome.tsx` - First example template generated by jsx mail

## Viewing your templates

Jsx Mail has a built-in email client simulator where with a single command all your email templates were available on a route from your localhost on the port defined in the `jsx-mail.json` file in the `servePort` field (by default is `3002`) you can start that server by running the following command:

```bash
pnpm jsxm serve
```

After executing this, a select will appear for you to select the email template you want to run, if you just want to run `Welcome` just move down with the arrow key on the keyboard until the `Welcome` template is selected. After that the CLI will ask you for fake data for each pro of the template in question (in the case of Welcome only the `name`) And after that the template will be opened in your default browser.

If you want to run all of them, just run the `serve` command as before, but this time choose the first option (All) and the link to all exported email templates will appear in the terminal, then just open whatever you want.

Every time a file in your email client folder changes it will restart the server with the changes made, however the browser will not be updated automatically, it is important to keep this in mind.

## Creating a template

How about we create our first template? now we are going to create a template to send a validation code to reset the user password of a sample application.

Inside the templates folder that is in your email application create a new file called `PasswordResetCode.tsx` and inside this file put the following code:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Group } from '@jsx-mail/components';

type Props = {
  code: string;
};

export function PasswordResetCodeTemplate({ code }: Props) {
  return (
    <Group>
      <h1>Reset your password</h1>
      <p>
        Your password reset code is <b>{code}</b>.
      </p>
    </Group>
  );
}
```

Open the `index.tsx` file which is located inside your email application. If you look you'll see that the `App` function is returning an object ([see more about](/docs/index-file)). The object being returned will look something like this:

```json
{
  Welcome: {
    componentFunction: WelcomeTemplate,
    props: {
      name: "string",
    },
  },
}
```

Add to it one more property called `PasswordResetCode` and in it add the `componentFunction` with the function you exported in the file we just created and the `props` with the properties that your email template expects to receive (in this case just the `code`) at the end the returned object will look like this:

```json
{
  Welcome: {
    componentFunction: WelcomeTemplate,
    props: {
      name: "string",
    },
  },
  PasswordResetCode: {
    componentFunction: PasswordResetCodeTemplate,
    props: {
      code: "123456",
    },
  },
}
```

And your entire `index.tsx` file should look like this:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { PasswordResetCodeTemplate } from './templates/PasswordResetCode';
import { WelcomeTemplate } from './templates/Welcome';

export default function App() {
  return {
    Welcome: {
      componentFunction: WelcomeTemplate,
      props: {
        name: 'string',
      },
    },
    PasswordResetCode: {
      componentFunction: PasswordResetCodeTemplate,
      props: {
        code: '123456',
      },
    },
  };
}
```

  The `props` entered for each component is fake data, which is used by jsx mail
  to render your template and test that your template is working with the most
  popular email clients.
</Callout>

## Rendering your template

So far we've only handled your email template with self development. But in procution your API or whatever part of the code is not going to be focused on doing that.

In order to re-render your email template and have its HTML where you can use it to send it as the body of an email we must first build your email application. The process of building in jsx mail is nothing less than doing the compatibility validations, transforming the jsx/tsx into Javascript and any other adaptations to make your email template more compatible with email clients.

This process must be done once for each change before executing the code that uses one of your templates, it can normally be run in your CI-CD process by your pipeline and to execute it just run:

```bash
pnpm jsxm build
```

To render your template (get the HTML and CSS from your template) we have two main ways. The first way is through your API (or any Javascript code snippet from your Back-End/where your email will be sent).

For this, in the root of your test project, we will create a file called `index.js` with the following content:

```js
const jsxMail = require('jsx-mail');

jsxMail
  .render('PasswordResetCode', {
    code: '123456',
  })
  .then(templateBody => {
    console.log(templateBody);
  });
```

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  You can replace the `then` with an `await` if you are running `jsxMail.render` in an
  asynchronous function and the code would look like this:

```javascript
const templateBody = await jsxMail.render('PasswordResetCode', {
  code: '123456',
});
console.log(templateBody);
```

</Callout>

The render function inside the `jsx-mail` package is an asynchronous function that receives as its first parameter the name of the email template (the same as the filename and the name of the object property that is exported in your `index.tsx` file.) and as a second object with all the `props` your email template expects to receive. it returns a string promise and this string is the html and css generated by your template, just use it to send it in the body of your email

Now run with node.js the file that renders your email template that we just created:

```bash
node index
```

You will get a result similar to this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html charset=UTF-8" />
    <title>PasswordResetCode</title>
    <style>
      body {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tr>
        <td align="left">
          <h1>Reset your password</h1>
          <p>Your password reset code is <b>123456</b>.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Congratulations!

Congratulations! you managed to get to the end of Get Started and with that you went through all the basic contents of Jsx Mail!
