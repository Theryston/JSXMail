# Configuration

Your JSX Mail project configuration is centralized in the `jsx-mail.config.js` file, situated at the root of your project. This file is essential for defining project-specific settings for JSX Mail.

### Example Configuration File

```js filename="jsx-mail.config.js"
/** @type {import('jsx-mail').JsxMailConfig} */
module.exports = {
  dir: 'mail',
};
```

This sample configuration file sets the basic parameter `dir`, indicating the directory where your mail files reside.

## Configurable Parameters

You have the flexibility to tailor your `jsx-mail.config.js` with various parameters to fit your project needs. Below are the available settings you can define:

- **`dir`**: Specifies the directory containing your mail templates. Default is `'mail'`.

- **`storage`**: Chooses the storage location for images. Options include `S3` for Amazon S3 storage or `JSX_MAIL_CLOUD` for [JSX Mail's default cloud storage](/docs/cloud). Default is `JSX_MAIL_CLOUD`.

- **AWS Configuration** (Used with `S3` storage option):
  - `awsAccessKeyId`: Your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Access Key ID.
  - `awsBucket`: The AWS bucket designated for image storage.
  - `awsFolder`: The specific folder within your AWS bucket for storing images.
  - `awsRegion`: The AWS region for your storage.
  - `awsSecretAccessKey`: Your AWS Secret Access Key.

- **`ignoreCloud`**: Set to `true` to bypass cloud storage for images. It's not recommended for production environments.

- **`onProcessChange`**: A callback function triggered during each status update in the `prepare` command. This function receives details about the current process event and related data.

These settings allow you to customize the behavior of JSX Mail, ensuring it aligns with your project's requirements and infrastructure.
