# About Components

When creating your email template, email clients advise the use of html tags that make everything more verbose or that will get a little more complicated with use. So for that, JSX Mail has some components that will make your life easier.

An example of this is the Group component which should be used as a div. Email clients advise using tables to align or group your html, but as we are no longer living in caves, we know that tables are very annoying to use. So the Group in the end is compiled to a table without you having to worry. [See more about the group component here](/docs/components/group)

```jsx
<Group align="center">
  <h1>Hello {name}, welcome to our website!</h1>
</Group>
```

```html
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <h1>Hello {{name}}, welcome to our website!</h1>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
