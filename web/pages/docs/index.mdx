# JSX Mail Quickstart

**JSX Mail** is a framework that allows you to create email templates in a modern way using the JSX syntax. Here you will be able to start a JSX Mail project and have an overview of how everything works.

To start you need to have a node.js project started with `package.json` already configured, if you want to use Typescript it is important that you have the `tsconfig.json` file too, let's create an example just with Javascript to be simpler to understand:

```bash
mkdir jsx-mail-quickstart
cd jsx-mail-quickstart
yarn init -y
```

Now let's actually start starting your project with JSX Mail, for this you can just install JSX Mail, and run the `init` command, at the end you need to run:

```bash
yarn add jsx-mail @jsx-mail/core
yarn jsxm init
```

After running this there will be some changes to your project:

- `jsx-mail` and `@jsx-mail/core` will be added to your `package.json` file
- A `jsx-mail.config.js` file will be created. This is the file where everything related to JSX Mail will be configured [see more](/docs/configuration)
- A `mail` folder will be created, this is where everything related to your emails will be, such as templates, components, images, etc. [see more](/docs/structure)

Now that everything is configured, let's see a preview of your templates. Just run the command:

```bash
yarn jsxm preview
```
