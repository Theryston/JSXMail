# JSX Mail Quickstart

**JSX Mail** is a framework designed for creating email templates using the modern JSX syntax. This guide provides a quickstart for initializing a JSX Mail project and offers an overview of its functionality.

To begin, ensure you have a Node.js project with a configured `package.json` file. If you're using TypeScript, a `tsconfig.json` file is also necessary. For simplicity, this example will focus on JavaScript:

```sh copy
mkdir jsx-mail-quickstart
cd jsx-mail-quickstart
yarn init -y
```

Next, let's set up your project with JSX Mail. Start by installing JSX Mail and then initialize it. Execute the following commands:

```sh copy
yarn add jsx-mail @jsx-mail/core
yarn jsxm init
```

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="jsx-mail-quickstart" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="mail" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="components">
        <FileTree.File name="featured.jsx" />
        <FileTree.File name="featured.styles.jsx" />
        <FileTree.File name="info.jsx" />
        <FileTree.File name="info.styles.jsx" />
        <FileTree.File name="layout.jsx" />
        <FileTree.File name="layout.styles.jsx" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.Folder name="templates">
        <FileTree.Folder name="zoo">
          <FileTree.File name="example.jsx" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.File name="welcome.jsx" />
        <FileTree.File name="welcome.styles.jsx" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.Folder name="assets">
        <FileTree.File name="code.png" />
        <FileTree.File name="logo.png" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="node_modules" />
    <FileTree.File name="jsx-mail.config.js" />
    <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
    <FileTree.File name="yarn.lock" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Upon completion, your project will undergo several changes:

- Your `package.json` file will now include `jsx-mail` and `@jsx-mail/core`.
- A new file, `jsx-mail.config.js`, will be created for configuring JSX Mail specifics. [Learn more](/docs/configuration).
- A `mail` directory is established, serving as the hub for your email-related content, like templates, components, and images. [Learn more](#mail-app).
- For TypeScript users, `tsconfig.json` will be updated with configurations essential for JSX Mail integration. [Learn more](/docs/typescript).

With everything set up, let's preview your templates. Run the following command:

```sh copy
yarn jsxm preview
```

This command launches a server on port `3256`, showcasing your template previews. They can be viewed at `http://localhost:3256`.

## Mail App

It's essential to familiarize yourself with the `mail` folder, which serves as the central hub for all your email-related activities. This folder includes various resources such as templates, components, images, and more.

Within the `mail` folder, you'll discover several subfolders, each with a specific purpose:

<Steps>

### Templates
This folder contains the email templates. These templates provide a predefined structure for your emails, allowing for consistency and efficiency in email creation.

### Components 

Here, you'll find reusable components. These are elements that you can utilize across different email templates, facilitating a more streamlined and cohesive design process.

### Assets

This folder is dedicated to storing assets such as images and other media files. These assets are essential for enriching your email content, making it more engaging and visually appealing.

</Steps>

You can also create other folder inside the `mail` folder, feel free to create any folder that you want, but it's essential to have a folder called `templates`.

Understanding the organization and function of each of these folders is crucial for effectively managing and creating your email content within the Mail App.

## Templates

All files with the extensions `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, or `.tsx` located in this folder are recognized as templates for crafting your emails in JSX Mail.

Each template must include a `default` export. This export is a function invoked to return your email template. It should return a JSX component, which JSX Mail will later render.

To better grasp this concept, let's walk through the creation of a basic template:

```jsx filename="mail/templates/my-first.jsx" copy
export default function MyFirst() {
  return <h1>Hello!</h1>;
}
```

Upon navigating to the preview page, you'll find a new template listed as `my-first`. This name is derived from the file name, excluding its extension. Selecting this template displays its content.

Templates can be enhanced with additional features like props, styles, or even a pre-render function. Let's delve into these advanced aspects:

### Template Name

The template's name is derived directly from its file name, excluding the file extension. For instance, in the given example, the template is named `my-first`.

To further organize your templates, you can utilize contexts. Any folder within the `mail/templates` directory is treated as a context. This feature allows for efficient categorization of templates. For example, you might create a `users` folder to store all user-related templates. In this scenario, the template's name would be formatted as `users:my-first`.

For more complex organization involving multiple folders, use a colon (`:`) to separate each folder's name in the template's name. For example, if you have a `users` folder and another named `products`, the template name could be `users:products:my-first`, reflecting the nested folder structure. This approach ensures a clear and structured naming system for your templates.

### Props

Props are a powerful feature in JSX Mail, allowing you to customize templates for various email contexts. By passing different values through props, you can reuse the same template structure while changing its content dynamically.

#### Defining and Using Props

To define props for your template, export a `props` object. This object should specify the types of the props. You then pass these props into the template function. Here's an example in JSX:

```jsx {1,2,3,5,6} filename="mail/templates/my-first.jsx" copy
export const props = {
  name: String()
};

export default function MyFirst({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello {name}</h1>;
}
```

For TypeScript users, the process is similar, with a slight modification to ensure type safety:

```tsx /typeof props/ filename="mail/templates/my-first.tsx" copy
export const props = {
  name: String()
};

export default function MyFirst({ name }: typeof props) {
  return <h1>Hello {name}</h1>;
}
```

#### Mock Values for Preview

When you open the template in the preview page without passing any values, the `name` will appear empty. To visualize how the template looks with sample data, you can assign mock values to the props:

```jsx /Theryston/ filename="mail/templates/my-first.jsx" copy
export const props = {
  name: String('Theryston')
};

export default function MyFirst({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello {name}</h1>;
}
```

With this change, the preview page will display "Hello Theryston". Remember, these mock values are only for preview purposes. When rendering the email template for actual use, you must provide the relevant props through the `render` function. [Learn more about rendering templates](#rendering-templates).

#### Important Notes

- The `props` object should list all the props you intend to use in your template.
- Omitting a prop from this object means it cannot be used within the template.
- Only templates that require props need to include the `props` object. This is not necessary for components.

### Styles

Styles enhance the visual appeal of your emails. JSX Mail allows you to add CSS styles directly to your templates, enabling customization of various elements.

#### Inline Styling

You can apply inline styles directly within your JSX tags. Hereâ€™s an example of setting a background color:

```jsx /style={{ backgroundColor: 'red' }}/ filename="mail/templates/my-first.jsx" copy
export const props = {
	name: String('Theryston'),
};

export default function MyFirst({ name }) {
	return <h1 style={{ backgroundColor: 'red' }}>Hello {name}</h1>;
}
```

#### External Style Sheets

For more complex styling or to maintain cleaner code, you can externalize your styles. Create a file ending in `styles.ts`, `style.ts`, `styles.js`, `style.js`, `styles.tsx`, `style.tsx`, `style.jsx`, or `styles.jsx`. In this file, export an object containing your styles:

```jsx filename="mail/templates/my-first.styles.jsx" copy
export const Title = { backgroundColor: 'red' };
```

For TypeScript users, ensure type safety by defining the style object as `JSX.ElementStyle`:

```tsx /: JSX.ElementStyle/ filename="mail/templates/my-first.styles.tsx" copy
export const Title: JSX.ElementStyle = { backgroundColor: 'red' };
```

#### Utilizing External Styles

Import the style object into your template or component and apply it:

```jsx {1} /style={Styles.Title}/ filename="mail/templates/my-first.jsx" copy
import * as Styles from './my-first.styles';

export const props = {
	name: String('Theryston'),
};

export default function MyFirst({ name }) {
	return <h1 style={Styles.Title}>Hello {name}</h1>;
}
```

With these steps, your template in the preview page will display "Hello Theryston" with a red background, as defined in the `Styles.Title` object.

#### Compatibility with Email Clients

It's important to note that some CSS properties may not be supported by all email clients. In this case, JSX Mail will report an error to you saying that the CSS property used is not compatible. JSX Mail's styling approach is similar to React.

### On Render

The `onRender` function is a powerful feature in JSX Mail, allowing you to execute specific logic before rendering a template. This can include fetching data from an API to dynamically populate your email content.

#### Creating the OnRender Function

To incorporate an `onRender` function, export it from your template file. This function takes the props as its argument and should return an updated props object with additional data for the template. Here's an example:

```jsx {7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15} filename="mail/templates/my-first.jsx" copy
import * as Styles from './my-first.styles';

export const props = {
	name: String('Theryston'),
};

export async function onRender({ name }) {
	const url = `https://api.github.com/users/${name}`;
	const response = await fetch(url);
	const user = await response.json();

	return {
		bio: user.bio,
	};
}

export default function MyFirst({ name }) {
	return <h1 style={Styles.Title}>Hello {name}</h1>;
}
```

The `onRender` function can be asynchronous, making it ideal for API calls or other asynchronous operations. It also receives props passed to the render function or defaults from the exported `props` object.

#### Updating Props Object

Ensure you include any new data fields returned by `onRender` in your `props` object. For instance, if `onRender` adds a `bio`, it should be declared in `props`:

```jsx {5} filename="mail/templates/my-first.jsx" copy
import * as Styles from './my-first.styles';

export const props = {
	name: String('Theryston'),
	bio: String(),
};

export async function onRender({ name }) {
	const url = `https://api.github.com/users/${name}`;
	const response = await fetch(url);
	const user = await response.json();

	return {
		bio: user.bio,
	};
}

export default function MyFirst({ name }) {
	return <h1 style={Styles.Title}>Hello {name}</h1>;
}
```

#### Utilizing the Props in the Template

Now, use these props normally within your template:

```jsx {18,22} filename="mail/templates/my-first.jsx" copy
import * as Styles from './my-first.styles';

export const props = {
	name: String('Theryston'),
	bio: String(),
};

export async function onRender({ name }) {
	const url = `https://api.github.com/users/${name}`;
	const response = await fetch(url);
	const user = await response.json();

	return {
		bio: user.bio,
	};
}

export default function MyFirst({ name, bio }) {
	return (
		<div>
			<h1 style={Styles.Title}>Hello {name}</h1>
			<p>{bio}</p>
		</div>
	);
}
```

When you visit the preview page, the template will display "Hello Theryston" with a red background and the fetched bio information.

With this understanding of creating a template with dynamic content, you're now ready to explore how to create a component.

## Components

In JSX Mail, files with the extensions `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, or `.tsx` that are not located in the `templates` folder but are within the [mail app](#mail-app) structure are identified as components. These components are reusable across different templates.

### Organizing Components

For optimal organization, it's advisable to create a `components` folder inside the `mail` directory. Here, you can store and manage your components.

#### Example of a Simple Component

Here's a basic example to illustrate how to create a component:

```jsx filename="mail/components/my-first-component.jsx" copy
export default function MyFirstComponent({ bio }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>I'm your first component. My function is to show the user's bio:</p>
      <p>{bio}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Note that for components, the `default` export is not mandatory. You can export any function, but it's advisable to use a function name that matches the file name for clarity and consistency.

#### Props in Components

Unlike templates, components do not require an exported `props` object. Simply use the props as needed within your component.

#### Integrating Components into Templates

You can easily import and utilize your components within templates. Here's how you can incorporate the `MyFirstComponent` into a template:

```jsx {1,23} filename="mail/templates/my-first.jsx" copy
import MyFirstComponent from '../components/my-first-component';
import * as Styles from './my-first.styles';

export const props = {
	name: String('Theryston'),
	bio: String(),
};

export async function onRender({ name }) {
	const url = `https://api.github.com/users/${name}`;
	const response = await fetch(url);
	const user = await response.json();

	return {
		bio: user.bio,
	};
}

export default function MyFirst({ name, bio }) {
	return (
		<div>
			<h1 style={Styles.Title}>Hello {name}</h1>
			<MyFirstComponent bio={bio} />
		</div>
	);
}
```

When you preview this template, it will display "Hello Theryston" with a red background, followed by "I'm your first component. My function is to show the user's bio:" and the user's bio.

You're now well-equipped to create components in JSX Mail. Next, let's explore how to incorporate images into your emails.

## Images

In JSX Mail, incorporating images into your emails, such as company logos or other visuals, is a straightforward process. The platform handles images efficiently, simplifying their integration into your templates or components.

For organized management of your images, it's recommended to create an `assets` folder within the `mail` directory. This folder is where you should store your image files.

### Using Images in JSX Mail

<Steps>

### Storing Images

Place your images in the `assets` folder. For example, download and save an image like `icon.png` in this folder. 

Download link for the image: [download](/icon.png).

### Importing Images

Just like in React, import the image into your template or component from the `assets` folder:

```jsx {3,23,24,25,26} filename="mail/templates/my-first.jsx" copy
import MyFirstComponent from '../components/my-first-component';
import * as Styles from './my-first.styles';
import IconPng from '../assets/icon.png';

export const props = {
	name: String('Theryston'),
	bio: String(),
};

export async function onRender({ name }) {
	const url = `https://api.github.com/users/${name}`;
	const response = await fetch(url);
	const user = await response.json();

	return {
		bio: user.bio,
	};
}

export default function MyFirst({ name, bio }) {
	return (
		<div>
			<img
				src={IconPng}
				alt="I'm an Icon"
			/>
			<h1 style={Styles.Title}>Hello {name}</h1>
			<MyFirstComponent bio={bio} />
		</div>
	);
}
```

</Steps>

### Image Optimization and Hosting

- **Optimization:** JSX Mail automatically optimizes images for email use.
- **Hosting:** The images are uploaded to [JSX Mail Cloud](/docs/cloud) for seamless integration into your emails.
- **Local Preview:** When previewing your template on the local machine, the images are loaded directly from your computer.

With this knowledge of adding and managing images in JSX Mail, you're now equipped to create visually appealing email templates. Next, let's explore the process of rendering these templates.

## Prepare

Before rendering your email templates with JSX Mail, it's essential to prepare your project. This preparation step ensures everything is set up correctly for rendering, including image uploads and template compilation.

### Running the Prepare Command

The `jsxm prepare` command is a crucial step in this process. To execute it, first, stop the preview server and run the following command in your terminal:

```sh copy
yarn jsxm prepare
```

This command triggers JSX Mail to handle various tasks such as:

- Uploading images to the JSX Mail Cloud.
- Optimizing images for email compatibility.
- Compiling the email templates.

### When to Use the Prepare Command

- **Frequency:** Run the `jsxm prepare` command whenever there are changes in your project, like adding new images, templates, or components.
- **Preview Page:** For the preview page, there's no need to manually run this command. The preview functionality automatically prepares your templates.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Integrate this command into your CI pipeline. It should be executed after installing dependencies but before deploying your project.
  
Here's an example of how to include it in your `package.json` file:

```json /jsxm prepare/ filename="package.json" copy
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "jsxm prepare && your-build-command"
  }
}
```

By following these steps, you ensure that your templates and assets are properly set up and optimized for rendering, contributing to a smoother and more efficient workflow in JSX Mail.

## Rendering Templates

Rendering templates in JSX Mail can be accomplished through two primary methods: using the Command Line Interface (CLI) or employing the `render` function provided by the `jsx-mail` package. Both options are designed to be straightforward and efficient.

### Rendering via CLI

To render a template using the CLI, execute a command like this:

```sh copy
yarn jsxm render "my-first" --out="my-first.html" --name="Theryston"
```

- **Template Name:** The first argument is the name of the template you wish to render.
- **Output File:** Specify the output file with the `--out` option.
- **Props:** Pass template props using `--{prop-name}`.

This method is quick and suitable for simple rendering tasks or testing.

### Rendering in Code

For more integrated scenarios, use the `render` function in your code:

```js filename="my-first.js" copy
const jsxMail = require('jsx-mail');

jsxMail
  .render('my-first', { name: 'Theryston' })
  .then((html) => console.log(html));
```

- **Template Name and Props:** The function takes the template name as the first argument and an object of props as the second.
- **Promise-Based:** It returns a promise, resolving to the HTML content of the rendered template.

### Exploring Default Templates and Components

JSX Mail provides default templates and components as a starting point. You can find these in the `mail` folder, offering insights and examples to guide your template creation.

## Summary

You now have the knowledge to create templates and components, add images, and render templates in JSX Mail. This guide covers the essentials to get you started on your journey with JSX Mail. 

Happy emailing, and see you in the next documentation! ðŸš€
