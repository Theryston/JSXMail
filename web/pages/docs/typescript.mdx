# TypeScript

TypeScript offers significant enhancements to your projects, including improved maintainability and error-checking capabilities. Fortunately, integrating TypeScript into your JSX Mail projects is straightforward and efficient.

### Steps to Integrate TypeScript with JSX Mail

<Steps>

### Initial Setup

Ensure TypeScript is installed and configured in your project before initializing JSX Mail with the command `jsxm init`.

### TypeScript Configuration Check

When initializing, JSX Mail's CLI will look for a `tsconfig.json` file in your project. If found, JSX Mail will automatically apply the following configurations to integrate seamlessly with TypeScript:

- **JSX Runtime Configuration:** Update `compilerOptions.types` in `tsconfig.json` to include `@jsx-mail/core/dist/jsx-runtime/jsx`. This step integrates JSX Mail's runtime for TypeScript projects.

- **JSX Import Source:** Modify `compilerOptions.jsxImportSource` in `tsconfig.json` to include `@jsx-mail/core/dist`. This change specifies the source for JSX components within JSX Mail.

- **JSX Syntax Support:** Add `react-jsx` to `compilerOptions.jsx` in `tsconfig.json`. This addition ensures that the TypeScript compiler properly interprets JSX syntax used in JSX Mail projects.

### Automatic JSX Typing

Post-configuration, JSX Mail automatically sets up JSX typing for your TypeScript project, streamlining the development process.
