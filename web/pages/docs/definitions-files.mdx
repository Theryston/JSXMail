# Definitions Files

The definitions files is the first file that JSX Mail will read. This file should export a function by default, this function is normally called `app` and this function should return an object where each element of the object is a template. Example of this object:

```json
{
  ConfirmEmail: {...},
  Welcome: {...},
  ResetPassword: {...}
}
```

In the example like this there will be 3 templates (ConfirmEmail, Welcome, ResetPassword) each of these email templates must have an object of it that contains an attribute called `props` (A representation of all props with data set to them) and `componentFunction` (A react component in function form, is not: `<SameComponent />` must be: `SameComponent`)

Finally your definitions files should look something like this: (the Welcome function can be in another file)

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Group } from '@jsx-mail/components';

const Welcome = ({ name }) => {
  return <Group>Hello {name}</Group>;
};

export default function App() {
  return {
    Welcome: {
      componentFunction: Welcome,
      props: {
        name: 'string',
      },
    },
  };
}
```
