# Clearing Cache

In scenarios where modifications are ineffective, errors occur, or a complete refresh is desired, clearing the cache is a straightforward solution. Utilize the following command to reset and clear cached data:

```sh
yarn jsxm cache clean
```

Upon executing this command, JSX Mail performs an extensive cache cleanup. The cache, created during the `jsxm prepare` process.

Initiating the cache cleaning process ensures that all JSX Mail internal directories are thoroughly cleared, allowing JSX Mail to function with updated data and settings.
