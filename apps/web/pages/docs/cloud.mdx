## Platform Login

To access your JSX Mail Cloud account through the platform, it is very simple, just go to the [sign in page](/cloud/sign-in) and enter your credentials. There you can also reset your password or even create an account if you don't already have one.

## Local Login

When it comes to your local machine, that is, in the terminal it is also very simple, normally when you type `jsxm init` JSX Mail already asks you to log in. But if you want to make sure, just type the command below to force JSX Mail to log in again:

```sh
yarn jsxm login
```

It's always good to keep in mind that logging into JSX Mail is done per project, that is, each project must have a different token, so you need to type this command above for each project (if you have an error accessing the JSX Mail API cloud).

## Production Login

Logging into production is also very simple, just follow the steps below:

- Go to your JSX Mail Cloud account [login page](/cloud/sign-in) and log in there.
- Click on the profile photo in the upper right corner and then on "Account" or click [here](/cloud/app/account)
- In the "Sessions" section you can click on "+ new session" and there you can create a section to use in production.

Once done you will have the token and the ID of your section, to authenticate your project in production with this token just copy the token and replace the `{{YOUR_TOKEN}}` with the token generated in the command below

```sh
yarn jsxm login --token {{YOUR_TOKEN}}
```

<Callout emoji="ðŸŒŸ">
  If you don't have a secure way to pass your token through the command line as
  shown above, you can just set the `__JSX_MAIL_TOKEN` environment variable (in
  an .env file for example) and run the `yarn jsxm login` command without
  passing the `--token {{ YOUR_TOKE }}` that JSX Mail will automatically load
  the variable `__JSX_MAIL_TOKEN`
</Callout>
