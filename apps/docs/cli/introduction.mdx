The JSX Mail CLI is a command-line interface that allows you to initialize, preview, login, logout and a lot more this.

To do this you just need to install the `jsx-mail` package to run the commands.

```bash
npm install jsx-mail
```

Now you can run the commands by using the `npx jsxm` prefix.

```bash
npx jsxm <command>
```

To see the list of all commands, you can run:

```bash
npx jsxm --help
```
