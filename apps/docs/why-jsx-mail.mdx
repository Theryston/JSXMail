A very common question is: **Why JSX Mail?**

Well, the answer is very simple: **Because it is the best choice for your email
needs**.

But let's dive into the details and see why JSX Mail is the best choice for
your email needs.

## Fully integrated

As we said before, JSX Mail is a **complete** email workflow tool that allows
you to do everything you need into a single place.

Basically, when you use JSX Mail, you don't need any other tool to complete
your email workflow. With JSX Mail, you can build your emails, send them, and
host your images in a **completely** different way that you never imagine.

## Simple usage

As JSX Mail can integrated fully into its ecosystem, you can use it in a very
simple way and this make it very easy to use.

For example, if you **not** using the JSX Mail, when you need to add an simple
image into your email, you need to use a external tool to host your image
and then you need to add the image URL into your email.

But if you **using** the JSX Mail, you can add your image into to your project
and `import` it as a simple file, then add it into a `img` tag and JSX Mail
will optimize, host, and replace the path per the image URL automatically in
the final rendered email.

## Compatibility

JSX Mail is compatible with all email clients, you can use it with Gmail,
Outlook, Apple Mail, and any other email client. This means that your emails
will be compatible with all email clients.

This happens because the JSX Mail framework not just transform your JSX
code into HTML, but it also compile each not supported tag to any other supported
tag that any email client can understand.

For example, if you use a `button` tag, JSX Mail will transform it to a `a` tag
and add a `target="_blank"` to it, because not all email clients support the
`button` tag.

## Developer friendly

JSX Mail is a **developer-friendly** we start our idea as just a framework,

email development experience.
