    <Accordion title="Is JSX Mail free?">
      Yes, the JSX Mail framework is free to use. However, the JSX Mail Cloud, which
      includes features like sending emails, storing assets, and more, is a paid
      service. That said, we pride ourselves on being the most affordable cloud
      solution for sending emails.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why not just use HTML and CSS?">
        You can use HTML and CSS to build emails, but it's not easy to maintain and
        create a good-looking email with HTML and CSS. JSX Mail provides a better
        developer experience and helps you to create a good-looking email.

    <Accordion title="Can I use JSX Mail Cloud with other frameworks?">
        Yes, you can see into the [API Reference](/api-reference) the JSX Mail Cloud
        if just a API that you call by giving a HTML body, and we will send it for
        you. So you can use any framework to build your email, and then just send it
        to JSX Mail Cloud.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can I use JSX Mail framework with other sending providers?">
        Yes, as you can see into the [rendering](/framework/rendering) section, you can
        use the JSX Mail framework just for generating the HTML body, and then you can
        use any sending provider to send your email.

        You can also [zip your email](/cli/zip) and get the files as images and then
        add it to any email platform that need a zip file.

    <Accordion title="Can I use the JSX Mail Cloud with other languages?">
        Yes, you can use the JSX Mail Cloud with any language that can send a HTTP
        request, like:

        - JavaScript/Node.js
        - Python
        - PHP
        - Ruby
        - Go
        - Rust
        - Java
        - C#
        - ...
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can I use the JSX Mail framework with other languages?">
        This is a good question, and our answer is: it depends.

        As you can see the JSX Mail framework is written in TypeScript.
        So it is basically a node.js framework. So to use it with other languages
        you need to have a node.js environment, or you can just compile your JSX
        code to a simple HTML (as you can see into the [rendering](/framework/rendering)
        section) and then use another language to send your email.
    </Accordion>
