JSX Mail is **not** just a framework, a library, or a cloud service. It is a
complete email workflow tool that allows you to build emails, send emails,
host your images, and much more.

It is very important to understand this because it will help you to understand
all the other parts of JSX Mail.

For this reason you can see sections into the docs like:

- [Framework](/framework)
- [Cloud](/cloud)
- [CLI](/cli)

All those parts of JSX Mail are **completely** independent and you can use
them **separately** per example you can use just the [Framework](/framework) to
build an email or just the [Cloud](/cloud) to send it.

But the **best** part is that you can use all of them **together** to build
your emails in a **completely** different way that you never imagine.

For example:

- Use the [Framework](/framework) to build your email
- Use the [Cloud](/cloud) to host your image
- Use the [CLI](/cli) to deploy your email to the [Cloud](/cloud)
