The Preview feature in JSX Mail acts as an interactive simulator, enabling real-time visualization of your email templates. This tool is specifically engineered to streamline and enhance the template development process.

## How to Use Preview

To activate Preview, execute the `preview` (or its shorthand `pv`) command in the Command Line Interface (CLI). This initiates the Preview on your web browser, accessible via port `3256`.

To start the Preview, use either of the following commands:

```sh
yarn jsxm preview
```

Or:

```sh
yarn jsxm pv
```

After running the command, visit: [http://localhost:3256](http://localhost:3256)

## Dynamic Refreshing

The Preview feature is designed to be responsive to changes in the `mail` folder. When any file within the `mail` folder is modified it performs the following steps:

- Clear the cache [with the cli](/cli/cache-clean)
- Execute the [prepare](/cli/prepare) process
- Render only the currently open template
- Update the Preview with the new HTML via websocket

This dynamic updating ensures that you always have a real-time view of how your email templates will appear, significantly improving your development workflow.
