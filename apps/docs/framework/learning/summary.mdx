Nice! Now you basically know everything about JSX Mail framework to start creating your own templates.

Here's a quick summary of the main points covered in this learning section:

- **Templates**: Reusable email made with JSX syntax.
- **Components**: Custom elements that can be used across multiple templates.
- **Assets**: External resources like images that can be referenced in templates.
- **Rendering**: How to render templates using the CLI or `render` function.

Is that it? No, definitely not! This is just the beginning.

There's a lot of things to learn about email development, but this is a good foundation.

Just keep going into the others sections of the documentation to dive deeper into JSX Mail.
