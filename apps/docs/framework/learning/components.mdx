In JSX Mail, files with the extensions `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, or `.tsx` that are not located in the `templates` folder are recognized as components.

For optimal organization, it's advisable to create a `components` folder inside the `mail` directory. Here, you can store and manage your components.

Here's a basic example to illustrate how to create a component:

```jsx mail/components/my-first-component.jsx
export default function MyFirstComponent({ bio }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p style={{ color: "red" }}>
        I'm your first component. My function is to show the user's bio:
      </p>
      <p>{bio}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Note that for components, the `default` export is not mandatory. You can export any function, but it's advisable to use a function name that matches the file name for clarity and consistency.

Unlike templates, components do not require an exported `props` object. Simply use the props as needed within your component.

## Components in Templates

You can easily import and utilize your components within templates. Here's how you can incorporate the `MyFirstComponent` into a template:

```jsx mail/templates/my-first.jsx
import MyFirstComponent from "../components/my-first-component"; // import the component
import * as Styles from "./my-first.styles";

export const props = {
  name: String("Theryston"),
  bio: String(),
};

export async function onRender({ name }) {
  const url = `https://api.github.com/users/${name}`;
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const user = await response.json();

  return {
    bio: user.bio,
  };
}

export default function MyFirst({ name, bio }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1 style={Styles.Title}>Hello {name}</h1>
      <MyFirstComponent bio={bio} /> {/* use the component */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

When you preview this template, it will display "Hello Theryston" with a red background, followed by "I'm your first component. My function is to show the user's bio:" and the user's bio.
