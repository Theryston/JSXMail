In JSX Mail, incorporating assets (like images) into your emails is a straightforward process. The platform handles images efficiently, simplifying their integration into your templates or components.

For organized management of your assets, it's recommended to create an `assets` folder within the `mail` directory. This folder is where you should store your image files.

## Adding Images

To add an image to your email, follow these steps:

1. Place the image in the `assets` folder.
2. Import the image and pass it as an `src` prop to the `img` tag.

```jsx mail/templates/my-first.jsx
import IconPng from "../assets/icon.png";

export const props = {
  name: String("Theryston"),
};

export default function MyFirst({ name }) {
  return <img src={IconPng} alt="I'm an Icon" />;
}
```

## Image Optimization and Hosting

- **Optimization:** JSX Mail automatically optimizes images for email use.
- **Hosting:** The images are uploaded to [JSX Mail Cloud](/cloud) for seamless integration into your emails.
- **Local Preview:** When previewing your template on the local machine, the images are loaded directly from your computer.
