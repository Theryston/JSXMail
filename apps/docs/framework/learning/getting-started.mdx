JSX Mail is a very powerful company that provides a full email workflow. It allows you to build emails, send emails, host your images, and much more.

But now we are getting started with the framework. The framework is a very powerful tool that allows you to build emails using JSX syntax.

## Start building

To begin, ensure you have a Node.js project with a configured `package.json` file. If you're using TypeScript, a `tsconfig.json` file is also necessary. For simplicity, this example will focus on JavaScript:

```sh
mkdir jsx-mail-quickstart
cd jsx-mail-quickstart
yarn init -y
```

Next, let's set up your project with JSX Mail. Start by installing JSX Mail and then initialize it. Execute the following commands:

```sh
yarn add jsx-mail
yarn jsxm init
```

## File structure

After running the `yarn jsxm init` command, the following file structure will be created:

- **jsx-mail-quickstart/**
  - **mail/**
    - **components/**
      - featured.jsx
      - featured.styles.jsx
      - info.jsx
      - info.styles.jsx
      - layout.jsx
      - layout.styles.jsx
    - **templates/**
      - **zoo/**
        - example.jsx
      - welcome.jsx
      - welcome.styles.jsx
    - **assets/**
      - code.png
      - logo.png
  - node_modules/
  - .gitignore
  - jsx-mail.config.js
  - package.json
  - yarn.lock

This file structure is essential to organize your project and facilitate the development of emails with JSX Mail.

## Preview your templates

With everything set up, let's preview your templates. Run the following command:

```sh
yarn jsxm preview
```

This command launches a server on port `3256`, showcasing your template previews. They can be viewed at `http://localhost:3256`.
