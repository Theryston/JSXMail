It's essential to familiarize yourself with the `mail` folder, which serves as the central hub for all your email-related activities. This folder includes various resources such as templates, components, images, and more.

Within the `mail` folder, you'll discover several subfolders, each with a specific purpose:

- **components/**: This directory houses reusable components that can be used across multiple templates.
- **templates/**: Contains individual templates, each tailored to specific use cases or design styles.
- **assets/**: Stores static assets like images, fonts, and other media files.

## Templates

Templates are the core of your email project. They are the starting point for building your email.

All files with the extensions `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, or `.tsx` located in the `templates` folder are recognized as templates for crafting your emails.

Each template must include a `default` export. This export is a function invoked to return your email template. It should return a JSX component, which JSX Mail will later render.

## Components

Components are reusable parts of your email. They can be used across multiple templates.

By default, all files with the extensions `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, or `.tsx` that are not inside the `templates` folder are recognized as components.

## Assets

Assets are static files that are used in your email. They can be used in your templates and components.

By default, all files that does not end with `.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.js`, or `.ts` are recognized as assets.
