To send an email, you have two ways to do it.

First, you can send an email by using the [API](/api-reference/introduction); this way you can send emails even if you are not using the [JSX Mail framework](/framework/learning/getting-started).

The second way to send an email is using the `jsx-mail` package. This way will render and send the email template to you, but you need to use the [JSX Mail framework](/framework/learning/getting-started).

In this page, we will see only the second way; to send using the first way, you can check the [API](/api-reference/endpoint/sender/send).

Before sending an email, it is good to keep in mind that you must first follow the [JSX Mail Cloud login](/cli/login#development) process.

Now you can send an email using JSX Mail Cloud. Here below is an example of how to do this:

```javascript
const jsxMail = require('jsx-mail');

await jsxMail.send('your:template:name', {
  subject: 'Your Email Subject',
  to: ['example@example.com'],
  props: { key: 'value' },
  sender: 'example@your-domain.com',
});
```

- The `subject` param is required and can be used to specify the subject of the email.

- The `to` param is required and can be used to specify the recipient of the email.

- The `props` param is also optional and can be used to pass props to the template, just if the template requires props.

- The `sender` param is optional and can be used to specify the [sender](/cloud/senders) of the email. The senders is from your JSX Mail Cloud account.

  - If you don't specify your sender, it will take the last created sender from your account.
  - You also can specify your sender from your JSX Mail configuration file, just by setting `defaultSender` on the configuration object. Just like:

  ```js jsx-mail.config.js
  /** @type {import('jsx-mail').JsxMailConfig} */
  module.exports = {
    dir: 'mail',
    defaultSender: 'example@jsxmail.org',
  };
  ```
