This is the official jsx-mail CLI, it is used to do things like build your email applications or even to serve your application in development mode (so you can see how your email template looks email in a very easy way through your browser).

## Installation

```bash
# with yarn
yarn add @jsx-mail/cli
# with npm
npm install @jsx-mail/cli
# with pnpm
pnpm add @jsx-mail/cli
```

## Usage

The two most important commands of this CLI are without a doubt the `build` and the `serve` commands. The build command is used to build your email application and is used to start a server that exposes your email templates (this is for ease of development).

```bash
# with yarn
yarn jsxm serve
yarn jsxm build
# with npm
npm jsxm serve
npm jsxm build
# with pnpm
pnpm jsxm serve
pnpm jsxm build
```
